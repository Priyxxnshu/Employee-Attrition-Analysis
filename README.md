## Project Overview
The main objective of this project is to explore the dataset to understand the factors correlated with employee attrition. The project includes the following components:

## Data Exploration
* Summary statistics to understand the dataset's basic characteristics.
* Distribution analysis for key features.
* Correlation analysis to identify relationships between attributes and attrition.
  
## Data Cleaning and Preparation
* Handling missing values and outliers.
* Encoding categorical variables.
* Normalizing and standardizing numerical features where appropriate.
* 
## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Visualization of data distributions and trends.
* Analysis of relationships between features and attrition.
* Identification of key patterns and trends within the data.
  
## Power BI Dashboard
In addition to the EDA, a Power BI dashboard has been created to provide a visual representation of the data. The dashboard includes:

* Attrition trends over time and by various categories (e.g., department, gender, job role).
* Visualizations showing the distribution of key features.
* Correlations between different factors and attrition.
To view the Power BI dashboard:

Open the Power BI file located in the dashboard/ directory.
If needed, connect to the dataset.
Explore the various tabs and visualizations to gain insights into employee attrition.

## Results and Conclusions
* Summary of key findings from the analysis.
* Insights into factors that influence employee attrition.
